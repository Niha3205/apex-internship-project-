# ðŸŽ¬ Task 5 â€” Movie Explorer

A Netflix-like **Movie Explorer** built as **Task 5** for the ApexPlanet internship sequence.
This project uses the **OMDb API** (demo key `thewdb`) to fetch movie data, displays featured movies, supports search, and shows detailed info in a modal popup.

## Features
- Dark, cinema-style UI (Netflix-inspired)
- Featured movies on home load
- Search movies by title
- Responsive movie cards with hover animation
- Modal popup for detailed movie info (Plot, Genre, IMDB rating)
- Contact form with validation

## Files
- `index.html` â€” Home (Featured + Search + Results + Modal)
- `contact.html` â€” Contact form (Feedback)
- `style.css` â€” Styling (dark theme)
- `script.js` â€” JS logic (API calls, modal, form validation)
- `README.md` â€” This file

## Demo
You can host this on GitHub Pages. The demo key `thewdb` is used for testing; for production, get your own OMDb API key.
